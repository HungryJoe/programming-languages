One of the aims of this course is to learn abstract concepts that we can use to understand any programming language. How can there be concepts that hold for all programming languges? That is why we need abstract concepts ([as abstract as possible, but not more](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/)). And the science of abstract but nevertheless precise concepts is mathematics.

But this is not a mathematics course, so I interweave the maths into the general flow of the lectures. This index gives a quick direct access to the maths of the course. Often there are only some definitions and examples as we didn't have time to go deeper into these topics.
