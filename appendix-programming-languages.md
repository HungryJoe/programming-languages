##### Programming languages you were interested in

- Fortran/Algol (sth old), 
- Go, 
- PhP, 
- Q#, 
- Matlab, 
- Ruby on Rails, 
- Rust
- Scala
- Arduino
- ... probably some more ... 

one language I would like to add is 

- Elm which used to be based on [Functional Reactive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming), but [moved to a new architecture](http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp). Elm is a programming to implement reactive systems, which is related to a discussion we had in class of how to reconcile the idea of functional programming with the idea of not having just one input and one output but rather streams of inputs and outputs (and continue computing/reacting potentially forever)

there was also the question about using python for a machine learning project ... I think you need to be able to argue that your project contributes to learning sth new about Programming Languages ... so if you used machine learning to analyse the data on github in order to learn sth new about Programming Languages that could be possible ... so I add

- machine learning Programming Languages data
