Notes and Materials for a Course on Programming Languages

## Lecture 1.1

### What is the topic of the course? Programming Languages ...

Let us start by looking at Githut

	Look at the top 49 languages
		"view by percentage of total":  
		the number of programming languages is growing

	not on githut: 
		Cobol, Algol, Simula, Ada, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Erlang, Prolog, Idris, 
		Isabelle, Agda, Coq, Promela, Anglican, ML, ...

	What other programming languages do you know?
			
	Can we bring some order into this?
	
### How are we going to study Programming Languages?

Clearly we cant learn all of them.

Let us take a step back and look at the landscape surrounding computer science:

Draw a map of the landscape (possibly add hardware/engineering on the left):

		programming    computer science    mathematics
		-----------------------------------------------

	1.  I see progress in this landscape following one (or many) S-shaped figures:

		------------->------------------>-------------
													  |
		-------------<------------------<-------------
		|
		------------->------------------>-------------
													  |
		-------------<------------------<-------------
		| 
		 ...

		 discuss some examples of S-shapes ...

		 btw, we might have to add a "hardware" column to the left of "programming" ...

	2.  We can place people in the landscape ... only a small number will be at home in all three areas
		
	3.  We can place programming languages:
		Questions: 
			For what purpose was a language invented?
			For what purposes is a language used now? Why?
			Which communities use the languages?
			...

### Activity: Place yourself in this landscape

Possibly with an arrow starting where you are and pointing where you want to be.
