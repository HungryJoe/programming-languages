Notes and Materials for a Course on Programming Languages

## Lecture 1.1

### What is the topic of the course? Programming Languages ...

Let us start by looking at Githut

	Look at the top 49 languages
		"view by percentage of total":  
		the number of programming languages is growing

	not on githut: 
		Cobol, Algol, Simula, Ada, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Erlang, Prolog, Idris, 
		Isabelle, Agda, Coqm, Promela, Anglican, ML, ...

	What other programming languages do you know?
			
	Can we bring some order into this?
	
### (2)

How are we going to study Programming Languages?

Clearly we cant learn all of them.

Let us take a step back and look at the landscape surrounding computer science:

draw a map of the landscape (possibly add hardware/engineering on the left):
		programming		computer science	mathematics
		-----------------------------------------------

	1.  I see progress in this landscape following one (or many) S-shaped figures:

		------------->------------------>-------------
													  |
		-------------<------------------<-------------
		|
		------------->------------------>-------------
													  |
		-------------<------------------<-------------
		| 
		 ...

		 one thing we could try to understand in this course is some of these S-shapes ...

		 btw, we might have to add a "hardware" column to the left of "programming" ...

	2.	we can try to place people in the landscape 
		only a small number will be at home in all three areas
		(some names that come to my mind: Alan Turing, Donald Knuth, Robin Milner, Vaughan Pratt, Benjamin Pierce, Phil Wadler, Peter O'Hearn, ...)

	3.	We can also fill in some programming languages:
		Questions: 
			For what purpose was a language invented?
			For what purposes is a language used now? why?
			Which communities use the languages?
			...

		Rough Proposal (dont divide the languages into columns in class):

		programming		computer science	mathematics
		-----------------------------------------------
		Fortran			Lisp, Algol, Ada
		C, Java			ML, Haskell			Isabelle, Agda, Coq
						Erlang,
		Python			Prolog, 		Idris
					    Anglican
					    				Promela
					    Go
