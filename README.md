Notes and Materials for a Course on Programming Languages

Spoiler Alert: For now, I don't recommend reading the notes ahead of the lecture as I am planning to develop the material together in class, so it can be more fun and more interesting if you don't yet know where we are heading. 

Below are linked the files containing the material covered already. I expect you to have read and reviewed this material before the next lecture. If anything is unclear, let me know and I am happy to add material.
