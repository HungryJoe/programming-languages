Let me know if you would want to hear more about sth in particular or if I should add sth to the lists below:

Some topics that showed up in the lectures but deserve more attention if there is time:
 - induction
 - pattern matching
 - computation is proof and proof is computation
 - ...
 
 Some topics planned for the future:
 - lambda calculus
 - types and a little type theory
 - what are dependent types?
 - polymorphism
 - just enough category theory to elucidate some of the concepts we learned
 - some theorem proving in proof assistants such as Isabelle and Idris
 - logic programming and Prolog
 - concurrency, transition systems, bisimulation
 - Kripke structures, modal logic, model checking, SPIN and Promela
 - extending the believes, desires, intentions paradigm in multi-agent systems
 - ... 
 
  The list is long and growing. I can easily add and remove things if you have particular interests ... let me know ...
